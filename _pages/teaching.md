### SUPA
As part of the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance [(SUPA)](https://www.supa.ac.uk), I have been giving an introductory course on molecular mechanics. The lectures slides can be found here:

* [2018 -- SUPA Slides]({{ site.url }}/downloads/SUPA_18.pdf)
* [2019 -- SUPA Slides]()

### CCPBioSim Workshops
[CCPBioSim](http://www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk) is a molecular modelling consortium in the UK that among other things also provides training for PhD students in molecular modelling. In 2019 I ran an introductory workshop on alchemical free energy calculations using BioSimSpace and Markov Modelling with pyEmmma.

Slides are available here:   
 
* [Alchemical free energy Introduction]({{ site.url }}/downloads/CCPBioSim-FEP-tutorial.pdf)   
* [Markov State Modelling]({{ site.url }}/downloads/CCPBioSim-MSM-tutorial.pdf)

The practical workshop material can be found on github:

* [Markov State Modelling workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/msm-workshop)


### Edinburgh Software Carpentries
If you are interested in getting started with Python, Bash, and git, checkout the Software Carpentries resource. Here is a list of Carpentries events I organised in Edinburgh:

## Tutorials and Best Practices
### Introduction to best practices in molecular simulations
Getting started with molecular simulations can be difficult, these best practices are a good starting point:

* [Molecular simulations](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5957-best-practices-for-foundations-in-molecular-simulations-article-v1-0)
* [Alchemical free energy simulations](https://github.com/michellab/alchemical-best-practices)

### Markov State Models
If you want to learn more about Markov State models the pyEmma tutorial are a good starting point:

* [Tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/markovmodel/pyemma_tutorials)
* [Tutorial paper](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5965-introduction-to-markov-state-modeling-with-the-pyemma-software-article-v1-0)
