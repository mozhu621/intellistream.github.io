# Mey Research Group Website

This is the website for my research at the University of Edinburgh.

The website has been adapted from the Allan lab website at Leiden University (https://www.allanlab.org)

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Plese feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).

Go to *aboutwebsite.md*  to learn how to copy and modidy this page for your purpose.
